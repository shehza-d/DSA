//Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.
//You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

//You can return the answer in any order.

// Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
// Output: [0,1]
// Explanation: Because nums[0] + nums[1] == 9, we return [0, 1]

// Input: nums = [3,2,4], target = 6
// Output: [1,2]

const twoSum = (nums, target) => {
  for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
    for (let j = 0; j < nums.length; j++) {
      if (i != j) {
        if (nums[i] + nums[j] == target) {
          return [i, j];
        }
      }
    }
  }
};
